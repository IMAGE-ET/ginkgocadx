<a name="1."><h1>1. Network Addressing</h1></a>
<p>Addressing a socket is not a trivial topic. A port number, transport layer
protocol, and possibly more than one IPv4 or IPv6 or DNS address must be 
given. The DNS has to be resolved, addresses have to be chosen, port numbers
must be resolved, and so on.

<p>Fortunately, nearly everything needed to represent an Internet address
can be encapsulated into a regular ordinary <tt>string</tt>, which can be
entered by the user. All thats needed is this string to create an
<tt>EndpointAddrlist</tt> object, although other information may be supplied
(in particular, the transport layer protocol -- UDP or TCP -- must be passed
outside of the string, for security reasons). EndpointAddrlist attempts to
take care of everything regarding addresses, including things which many
applications would otherwise ignore (such as multiple addresses per name).

<p><tt>Endpoint</tt> accepts EndpointAddrlist as remote and local addresses,
in which case all the addresses shall be tried. EndpointAddress encapsulates
just one.

<a name="2."><h1>2. EndpointAddrlist Class</h1></a>
<p>EndpointAddrlist encapsulates an array of <tt>addrinfo</tt>s obtained
through the protocol-independent <tt>getaddrinfo</tt>. Although the class
name is singular, it is possible for multiple addresses to be listed within.
Your application can choose to ignore all but one, but its recommended to
try to connect to alternative addresses if the first one doesn't work,
instead of giving up.

<a name="2.1."><h2>2.1. Constructors</h2></a>
<p>The following arguments are accepted, in order:

<h3>string hostname</h3>
<p>A hostname. This is passed to <tt>getnameinfo</tt> which either resolves
the DNS name or uses <tt>inet_pton</tt> to convert from presentation form
to numeric form. Note that <tt>inet_pton</tt> only supports dotted-decimal
IPv4 or hex-string IPv6 addresss, and <b>not</b> the following alternative 
IPv4 address formats (which <tt>inet_aton</tt> and therefore ping support):
<ul>
<li><b>Implied octets</b>: 127.1 = 127.0.0.1, 127.1.2 = 127.1.0.2
<li><b>Hexadecimal octets</b>: 0x7f.0.0.0 = 127.0.0.1
<li><b>Octal octets</b>: 0377.0377.0377.0377 = 255.255.255.255
<li><b>Binary octets?</b>
<li><b>Dotless addresses</b>: 2130706433 = 127.0.0.1,
0x7f000001 = 127.0.0.1, 017700000001 = 127.0.0.1
</ul>
<p>Regular dotted-decimal strings such as "127.0.0.1" (IPv4) and hex string
"::1" (IPv6) are allowed. DNS names may resolve to either IPv4 or
IPv6 addresses, depending on if A or AAAA resource records exist.
If your host doesn't support both IPv4 and IPv6, either one can be disabled
by setting the default address family later on.

<p>The hostname can also contain a service port, in URL-style. That is,
a hostname followed by a colon and then a port, rather than a period. Netstat
represents port 139 of 10.0.0.2 as "10.0.0.2.139", but this is not acceptable.
"10.0.0.2:139" is supported by this class, and has the advantage of being
aesthetically pleasing and easy to parse. With one exception.

<p>IPv6 addresses contain embedded colons. However, they always contain
more than one colon. "::1" is interpreted as an IPv6 address with no port,
while "127.0.0.1:1" is interpreted as port 1 on 127.0.0.1. So how can port
names be specified with IPv6 addresses? Several purposals have been made, but
the best by far (and the one which this class understands) is to enclose
the IPv6 address in brackets, like so: [::1]:80 = port 80 of ::1. IPv6-enabled
web browsers understand this. The parser is loose about what is accepted:
[::1]80, ::1]:80 and even ::1]80 will be interpreted identically, but you 
shouldn't rely on this. For orthogonality (the [] notation has roots in
email systems), an IPv4 address is acceptable in brackets:
[127.0.0.1]:80 works as expected. Brackets also turn on AI_NUMERICHOST, which
prevents DNS resolving -- [example.com]:80 won't work, but example.com:80 will.
<i>Brackets enclose literals, they are optional with IPv4 but required with
IPv6</i>.

<p>If a port is given, it replaces the <tt>service</tt> variable, described
below. This is to allow users to override default port numbers in case of an
emergency. It should not be viewed as a security concern.

<h3>string service = ""</h3>
<p>The service name resolves to a port number through <tt>services</tt>.
This means you can specify human-readable service names such as 
"http" for port 80 TCP. Numeric strings are also allowed, such as "80";
this is passed to <tt>getaddrinfo</tt> and handled there.

<p><tt>getaddrinfo</tt> handles this input, but before it gets to it, this
class interprets port numbers with commas in them. The port number is 16-bits,
and both octets can be specified as two 0-255 integers, separated by a 
common; for example, "1,2" is 0x0102. This is most useful for raw ICMP sockets;
they understand the first octet as the type code and the second as the code
code (this is specific to the Endpoint library). Other bases besides decimal
are not supported.

<p>This argument can often be omitted if you know for sure <tt>hostname</tt> 
will
contain a port number, but specifying it is most useful for allowing a 
default port if none is specified in <tt>hostname</tt>.

<h3>int type = 0</h3>
<p>A bitmask of the following:
<ul>
<li><b>TCP</b> - Transport Control Protocol
<li><b>UDP</b> - User Datagram Protocol
<li><b>RAW_<i>xxx</i></b> - Raw socket with transport-layer protocol <i>xxx</i>
</ul>
And:
<ul>
<li><b>CLIENT (0)</b> - Actively connects to another host
<li><b>SERVER (1)</b> - Passively waits for another host to connect
</ul>
<li>
<p>The default is TCP | CLIENT, which seems to be the most common.

<p>To use IPv4 raw sockets on Unix, you need root access. You also need to give
the transport-layer protocol; these are derived from IPPROTO_, see protocols.h.
For example, to send raw ICMP packets, use RAW_ICMP, to send raw UDP, RAW_UDP.
Endpoint will make the IP header for you unless you choose RAW_RAW, in which
case you can do it yourself. The idea is that you RAW_xxx makes the raw IP as
well as xxx header for you, although this is only implemented with RAW_UDP
presently.


<h3>int family = EndpointAddrlist::g_default_family</h3>
<p>Specifies the address as well as protocol family. Allowed values are:
<ul>
<li><b>AF_UNSPEC</b>: "unspecified", host is dual-stack and supports both
IPv4 and IPv6 (either is acceptable)
<li><b>AF_INET</b>: Only want IPv4 addresses
<li><b>AF_INET6</b>: Only want IPv6 addresses
</ul>
<p>EndpointAddrlist::g_default_family can be set on a global (or at least
program-wide) scale, to reflect which protocol families the host supports.
An IPv4-only host would set this to AF_INET, an IPv6-only host AF_INET6,
a dual-stack IPv4 and IPv6 host would use AF_UNSPEC.

<h3>EndpointAddress GetAddress()</h3>
<p>Returns the current address. Unless GetAddressNext() is called, this is the
first address. See GetAddressNext(), which is preferred for most applications.
However, GetAddress() has its uses; sometimes there is no reason to try
multiple names, for example if there is no DNS name.

<h3>EndpointAddress GetAddressNext()</h3>
<p>Return the current address, and move to the next one (post-increment).
This should be done instead of just trying to use the first address. The
proper protocol is to try each address, until one succeeds.

<a name="3."><h1>3. EndpointAddress</h1></a>
<p>Encapsulates a single address. This is a subclass of the <tt>addrinfo</tt>
structure, whose declaration is reproduced below:
<pre>
struct addrinfo {
        int     ai_flags;       /* AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, AI_NUMERICHOST */
        int     ai_family;      /* PF_xxx */
        int     ai_socktype;    /* SOCK_xxx */
        int     ai_protocol;    /* 0 or IPPROTO_xxx for IPv4 and IPv6 */
        size_t  ai_addrlen;     /* length of ai_addr */
        char    *ai_canonname;  /* canonical name for hostname */
        struct  sockaddr *ai_addr;      /* binary address */
        struct  addrinfo *ai_next;      /* next structure in linked list */
};
</pre>
<p>There is also an m_bool boolean value, which is true if the fields above
are valid.</p>

<a name="3.1."><h2>3.1. Constructor</h2></a>
<p>EndpointAddrlist(addrinfo*) is the only constructor. If the pointer is
non-null, each field is copied shallowly and m_bool is true. If null, 
m_bool is false.

<h2>operator string()</h2>
<p>Stringifies the address by returning IP() + ":" + Port(). The reason why 
IP() is
returned rather than its DNS name is threefold: not all hosts have DNS
names, DNS names may have more than one host, and forward/reverse DNS may
not match. If IP() contains a colon, it is put in square brackets as is
customary with IPv6.

<h2>string IP()</h2>
<p>Returns a human-readable form of the address. operator string() calls
this. The IP address will be returned, as either a dotted-decimal or
hex string.

<p>This function internally calls <tt>inet_ntop</tt> (numeric to
presentation) with the proper flags and passing the proper structures,
depending on if the address is IPv4 or IPv6. Manually, this is tedious.
WinSock does not provide <tt>inet_ntop</tt> so a implementation copied
from BIND is provided.

<h2>string DNS()</h2>
<p>Returns the canonical DNS name in ai_cannonname, or an empty string 
if there is none.

<h2>string Name()</h2>
<p>Returns DNS() if not empty, else IP().

<h2>string Port()</h2>
<p>Returns the port number.

<h2>operator bool()</h2>
<p>Returns m_bool, which is false if there is no address.

<a name="4."><h1>4. File Locations</h1></a>
<p><tt>services</tt> and <tt>hosts</tt> are used during service
and name resolution (name resolution additionally uses DNS). Both these
files can be by default found in the following locations:
<ul>
<li><b>Unix:</b> /etc
<li><b>Windows NT, 2000, XP:</b> C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc, C:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc
<li><b>Windows 95, 98, Me:</b> C:\windows
</ul>

<a name="5."><h1>5. Errors From <tt>getaddrinfo()</tt></h1></a>
<p>A non-zero return value from <tt>getaddrinfo</tt> is one of the following,
organized in order of likelihood, from greatest to least. The Posix 1g and
Win32 constants as well as BSD and Win32 <tt>gai_strerror</tt> results are
included as well.

<a name="5.1."><h2>5.1. Resolution Errors</h2></a>
<p>If an error occurs, <tt>m_bool</tt> is set to false,
<tt>m_error_code</tt> is set to <tt>EP_ERROR_GETADDRINFO</tt>, and
<tt>m_error_str</tt> is set to a description of the problem.

<p>Unless literals are given, the hostname and service name need to be
resolved. Errors can happen in this process.


<h3>EAI_AGAIN = WSATRY_AGAIN</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "Temporary failure in name resolution."
</ul>
<p>There was a temporary DNS failure and you should try again.

<h3>EAI_FAIL = WSANO_RECOVERY</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "Non-recoverable failure in name resolution."
</ul>
<p>A real bad error.	

<h3>EAI_NODATA = WSANO_DATA / EAI_NONAME</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "No address associated with <i>hostname</i>."
</ul>
<p>This was removed from RFC, its equivalence or lack thereof to
EAI_NONAME is unknown. The latest version of Windows defines EAI_NODATA
to EAI_NONAME.	

<h3>EAI_NONAME = WSAHOST_NOT_FOUND</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "<i>hostname</i> or <i>service</i> not provided, or not known."
<li><b>Win32:</b> "No such host is known."
</ul>
<p>Not provided or no address associated with hostname.

<h3>EAI_SERVICE = WSATYPE_NOT_FOUND</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "<i>service</i> not supported for ai_socktype."
<li><b>Win32:</b> "The specified class was not found."
</ul>
<p>The symbolic service name could not be resolved, the entry in
<tt>services</tt> is missing. The reference to "ai_socktype" means
that if you try to connect to the "domain" service with TCP, and 
the <tt>services</tt> file only has an entry for TCP, you'll also get this 
error (although most systems now define both TCP and UDP for all services).
This error never happens with numeric port numbers, so if
you're concerned about portability, use them. Win32's <tt>services</tt>
is quite small and doesn't cover all the esoteric service names, although
it has its uses with custom servers (if you use a symbolic service name
in your server and the user wants to change the port, all he has to do is 
change the definition in <tt>services</tt> -- however, your install
program must add a line to the file.).

<a name="5.2."><h2>5.2. Usage Errors</h2></a>
<p>These errors are mostly the fault of the programmer; either you (the class
user) or me (the class programmer). Errors that "should not happen" should
not happen under class design, even if invalid parameters are passed to the class.


<h3>EAI_FAMILY = WSAEAFNOSUPPORT</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "<i>ai_family</i> not supported."
<li><b>Win32:</b> "An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used."
</ul>
<p>hints.ai_family is invalid. The address family is specified as the last
argument, and can be either AF_UNSPEC (IPv4 and/or) IPv6, AF_INET (IPv4),
or AF_INET6 (IPv4). If the parameter is not given,  
EndpointAddress::g_default_family is used. Either the default family 
(which defaults to AF_UNSPEC) or the passed family is invalid.


<h3>EAI_BADFLAGS = WSAEINVAL</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "Invalid value for <i>ai_flags</i>."
<li><b>Win32:</b> never generated?
</ul>
<p>Valid values are AI_PASSIVE, AI_CANONNAME, and AI_NUMERICHOST.
EndpointAddress only sets AI_PASSIVE (for servers) and AI_NUMERICHOST
(for bracketed literals) so this should never happen.

<h3>EAI_MEMORY = WSA_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY</h3>
<ul>
<li>BSD: "Memory allocation failure."
</ul>


<h3>EAI_ADDRFAMILY</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "Address family for <i>hostname</i> not supported."
<li><b>Win32:</b> N/A
</ul>
<p>Presumably this means an address family other than AF_UNSPEC was
given, and no address of that type is associated with the hostname.
Does not exist on Win32.</p>


<h3>EAI_SOCKTYPE = WSAESOCKNOSUPPORT</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "<i>ai_socktype</i> not supported."
<li><b>Win32:</b> "The support for the specified socket type does not exist in this address family."
</ul>
<p>hints.ai_socktype is invalid. EndpointAddrlist sets this field to
either SOCK_DGRAM for UDP or SOCK_STREAM for TCP so this should never happen.

<h3>EAI_SYSTEM</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>BSD:</b> "System error returned in <i>errno</i>."
<li><b>Win32:</b> N/A
</ul>
<p>This error code code is rarely used, but it means the errno variable
will contain additional error information. Does not exist on Win32 (and most Unixes).
</ul>
