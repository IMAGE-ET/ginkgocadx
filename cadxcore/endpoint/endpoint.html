<h1>Endpoint C++ Socket Library</h1>
<p>Endpoint is a C++ class which uses Berkeley sockets to communicate with
hosts via the Internet, through IPv4 or IPv6, using TCP or UDP or raw IP,
on Win32 or Unix operating systems. Originally written for developing
peer-to-peer applications, the simple philosophy behind Endpoint
is of <i>choice</i> and <i>portability</i> and <i>consistency</i>:

<ul>
<li><b>Protocol-family independence</b> - IPv4 or IPv6, transparently
<li><b>Socket-type independence</b> - UDP or TCP, client or server created similarly
<li><b>Platform-indepedence</b> - works on Win32 and Unix
</ul>

<p>Additionally, <b>data is data</b>. It shouldn't matter how it gets there,
via IPv4 or IPv6, on a Win32 or Unix platform. The addressing and connection
establishment is the tough part, which this class hierarchy tries to address.
New protocol family-independent calls are used, nullifying the need to port
to IPv6 once IPv6 becomes more widely used.

<p>Also, Endpoint is to be optimized for typical cases, while still
retaining desired functionality. Byte counters are an example of this,
as is multiple addresses per host. In the future, perhaps multicasting will
be transparently available.

<h2>Platforms</h2>
<p>Endpoint has been compiled and tested successfully on the following
operating systems:
<ul>
<li>FreeBSD 5.1-CURRENT, G++ 3.3.1
<li>FreeBSD 4.8-STABLE, G++ 2.95.4
<li>Microsoft Windows XP, VC++ 6.0 - raw sockets tested
<li>Microsoft Windows 2000, VC++ 6.0
<li>Microsoft Windows Me, VC++ 6.0
</ul>
<p>Portability is a major goal. Testers welcome.

<h2>Feature List</h2>
<p>Currently:
<ul>
<li>UDP, TCP, IPv4 raw sockets
<li>Active or passive open (CLIENT or server)
<li>Protocol independence
<li>IPv4 or IPv6 with automatic getaddrinfo() DNS resolution
<li>Automatic creation IPv4 header for raw sockets unless RAW_RAW given
<li>Automatic creation of UDP header for RAW_UDP sockets, with proper ports
<li>Automatic creation of ICMP header, "code,type" dest port specification
<li>Optional <tt>Endpoint::g_raw_sockfd</tt>, set this to a raw socket
    descriptor and all raw sockets will use it. Allows Endpoint to be ran
    without root priviledges. Can also be passed through <tt>RAWSOCKFD</tt>
    environment variable if <tt>setup_raw()</tt> is called first.
<li>Socket options, SetOptOn, uses setsockopt
<li>Error handling
</ul>

<p>Not implemented (yet):
<ul>
<li>A pluggable mechanism for registering creation of new layer-4 raw protocols
    so for example, create_igmp() creates raw IGMP packet headers. Extensive
    as possible. (Currently only UDP and ICMP create headers for you).
    Perhaps 
<a href="http://www.packetfactory.net/Projects/Libnet/">Libnet</a> would be
better for this purpose.
<li>A shorter method of creating RAW sockets. Endpoint ep(RAW);
<li>Easily usable I/O: ep << "foo"; ep >> input. Stream compatible.
<li>Optional everything - optional service names
<li>IP options - rarely used, but would be nice to have (long fat pipe)
<li>readfrom/sendto - with null sockaddr by default?
<li>readv, writev, recvmsg, sendmsg - perhaps
<li>IPv6 raw sockets - no such thing
<li>Datalink access - could use libpcap but not socket interface portably
<li>Out-of-band data/urgent data for TCP - rarely used
<li>Application-layer protocols - belong in other classes, but todo
<li>Non-blocking I/O - not very efficient, existed in earlier versions but
    was taken out
<li>Signal-driven I/O - blah
<li>select and poll - hows this fit in?
<li>Unix Domain Sockets - although useful, not completely portable (Win32)
<li>Routing Sockets - no datalink access yet so can't be done, belongs in app
<li>Broadcast
<li>Multicast - I like it, should perhaps be implemented, but not much support
<li>threading - belongs in client app
<li>XTI - never
</ul>

<h1>Endpoint Class</h1>
This class implements a "socket", a single endpoint connected to another
endpoint. Member variables m_remote and m_local represent these; they are 
of type EndpointAddrinfo.

<h2>Constructors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Endpoint::Endpoint(int type, EndpointAddrlist addr)
<li>Endpoint::Endpoint(int type, string hostname, string service = "")
<li>Endpoint::Endpoint(int type, EndpointAddrlist remote, EndpointAddrlist local)
<li>Endpoint::Endpoint(int type, string remotehost, string remoteservice,
    string localhost, string localservice)
</ul>
<p>The one-address constructors interpret the address as local if <tt>type</tt>
specifies a server, remote if client -- and then calls the two-address constructor.
The string parameters just create <tt>EndpointAddrlist</tt>s and pass them to the
others. Each constructor is implemented as a <tt>Create</tt> method, the real
constructor simply calls this. Notice how address lists as opposed to a single
address are passed: if the first one fails, the others are tried; m_local and
m_remote are set to the connected <tt>EndpointAddress</tt>es.

<h3>int type</h3>
<p>Specifies protocol and client/server, see address.html.

<h3>string hostname</h3>
<p>See address.html. For clients, this is the remote
address, for servers, this is the local address.

<h3>string service</h3>
<p>Default service, see above.

<h2>operator string()</h2>
<p>Returns the socket pair as a string, for example:
"127.0.0.1:8000 <--> 127.0.0.1:3402". The local address
is shown first followed by the foreign address. Invalid addresses are shown as 
"(invalid)".

<h2>operator bool()</h2>
<p>Returns true if is connected (m_bool member variable). More useful with
TCP sockets than UDP sockets. connect() rarely fails with UDP sockets; you'll
usually be notified of a UDP port being closed when you try to write to it. If
you want to make sure, write a 0-byte packet and abort if it fails. Endpoint
doesn't do this for you because that might interfere with the data.

<h2>bool Write(string)</h2>
<p>Writes all data in string, looping if necessary. Calls send(). If any
of the send() calls returns -1, returns false. This means the remote host
closed the connection, and if you try to send more you'll cause a SIGPIPE
on Unix.

<h2>std::string Stats()</h2>
<p>Return a string of various statistics of the socket usage.
You can also call the socket-wide <tt>GetBytesRecv()</tt>,
<tt>GetBytesSent()</tt>, or application-wide
<tt>GetAllBytesRecv()</tt> and
<tt>GetAllBytesSent()</tt> calls individually.

<h2>int m_error_code; std::string m_error_str</h2>
<p>Error codes and error strings. Check these if !ep (m_bool=false). 
Defined values for
<tt>m_error_code</tt> are EP_ERROR_NONE, EP_ERROR_SOCKET, EP_ERROR_BIND,
EP_ERROR_ACCEPT, EP_ERROR_SETSOCKOPT, EP_ERROR_CONNECT, EP_ERROR_ADDRESS,
and the EndpointAddrlist error EP_ERROR_GETADDRINFO. Each code corresponds to
the system call where an error occured.
<tt>m_error_str</tt> is a descriptive, human readable string of the error,
suitable for printing. If Endpoint attempts to create an EndpointAddrlist and
fails, the error will propagate into these variables.

<h2>static int set_raw_sockfd(int fd)</h2>
<p>Set the socket descriptor <tt>g_raw_sockfd</tt> used for raw sockets, to fd.
Useful for, on Unix, separating the <tt>socket()</tt> call (which usually has
to run as root) with the rest of the application code.

<h2>static void Initialize()</h2>
<p>Initialize the socket library. Necessary on Win32; this function is called
upon the first instanciation of an Endpoint object. On other platforms,
nothing happens.

<h1>References</h1>
<p>Endpoint isn't the only C++ class to utilize TCP/IP sockets, nor does
it claim to be the best. Below are other C++ classes whose purpose is the
same as or similar to that of Endpoint's, so one can learn from them.

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>On Win32, where is the inet_ntop function?</h2>
<p>WinSock is missing this function. The implementation from BIND is
included in <tt>inet_ntop.c</tt>. You can link to <tt>inet_ntop_ipv4.c</tt>
if you only want IPv4 and want to save a little space, but in general
<tt>inet_ntop.c</tt> is preferred. Add this file to your project if you
get an <tt>error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _inet_ntop</tt>.</p>

<h2>On Win32, I get an error saying <tt>getaddrinfo</tt> or <tt>addrinfo</tt>
is not found, what can I do?</h2>
<p>You need to download the <i>core</i> "Microsoft Platform SDK" which includes
this function. Ask Google for where to download this. Copy the files from "include"
to your Microsoft Visual Studio "include" directory, overwriting them. The compile should now work.

<h2>On Win32, I get tons of link errors, how do I fix it?</h2>
<p>You need to link with <tt>ws2_32.lib</tt>, and the object files of
<tt>endpoint.cpp</tt>, <tt>address.cpp</tt>, and <tt>inet_ntop.c</tt>. Also
link to <tt>ws2_32.lib</tt> under Project -> Settings -> Link -> General
-> Object/library modules.

<h2>On Win32, should I include support for "Windows Sockets" in the MFC
  AppWizard?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, no, as the afxsock.h header will conflict with Endpoint.
If you created a project with WOSA support, you can fix it by removing 
#include &lt;afxsock.h> from stdafx.h and replacing AfxSocketInit() with
Endpoint::Initialize(). Also, you may have to change the precompiled header
option (Project -> Settings -> C++ -> Category=Precompiled Headers) from
"Use precompiled header file (.pch" to "Automatic use of precompiled
headers" through stdafx.h. Endpoint doesn't include stdafx.h.

<h2>On Win32, I get <tt>fatal error C1189: #error :  WINDOWS.H already 
included.  MFC apps must not #include &lt;windows.h&gt;</tt>.</h2>
<p>Include endpoint.h in stdafx.h, <i>after</i> the normal afx includes.

<h2>Are raw sockets supported on Win32?</h2>
<p>Yes, provided your version supports it (Windows XP or Windows 2000). You
may be able to create raw sockets as normal users.
